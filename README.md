##### iPhone Project

The `/mobile` directory contains the BiteBook iPhone application. This is built on the Appcelerator Titanium platform.

You'll need a copy of of the TiPebble module by [Joe Beuckman](https://github.com/jbeuckm); however, I've made some changes to the module, so until those changes are merged into his repository you should use [my fork](https://github.com/mcongrove/TiPebble).

##### Pebble Project

The `/pebble` directory contains the BiteBook Pebble application. This uses the standard Pebble SDK.
